# Server (this repo) - https://github.com/Wiggmund/superhero-gallery-server 
    ## Must have - PostgreSql 14 and above, and create database "superhero-gallery"
    ## To start - npm run start:dev
    
# Client - https://github.com/Wiggmund/superhero-gallery-client
    ## To start - npm run start:dev
    
# Notes
    ## I didn't have time to make a Client at all. The server is fully operational. Maybe it will be possible to add some functionality, but the main thing is that the server is not tested and not documented using Swagger

    ## If it were possible, I would complete the project
